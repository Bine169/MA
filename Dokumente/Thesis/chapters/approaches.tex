\section{Area segmentation approaches and their implementation}

\subsection{Segmentations considering homogenous distribution}

\paragraph{Considering just Criteria}

\paragraph{Considering average criteria value in proportion to number of locations}

\subsection{Segmentations considering distance}

\paragraph{Considering just Distance}

\subsection{Segmentations considering criteria and distance}

\paragraph{Criteria and Distance: from inside to outside: SmallestCritGetsNearest}

\paragraph{Criteria and Distance: from inside to outside: SmallestCritGetsTrueNearest}

\paragraph{Criteria and Distance: from outside to inside + inside to outside}

\paragraph{sum of criteria divided by number locations + Distance}

\paragraph{Distance + criteria}

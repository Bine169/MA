\section*{Acknowledgement}

First of all I thank Microm Micromarketing-Systems and Consult GmbH which offer the possibility to do my master thesis within that interesting field of Geomarketing. They have been supported me during the whole time of implementation very well. Additionally microm provided all data which were necessary to do the implementation. Especially I would like to thank Andreas Strade and Sven Reifegerste. \\
Furthermore I thank my first supervisor Dr. Torsten Prinz who helped in case of any questions or problems.\\
Alexander Butsch from KIT Institute of Operations Research provided some information about compactness measures and answered my question quite well. Therefore I would like to thank you.\\
Without the help of my boyfriend and my family the realisation of this thesis would not have been possible. Throughout the entire period producing the thesis they have been supported me very well. I thank all of them very much with special thanks to my boyfriend.
